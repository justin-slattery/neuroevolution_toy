# neuroevolution_toy

Developing a toy neuroevolutionary algorithm for controlling the behavior of a single agent. The agent will be evolved to improve its performance on a simple navigation task. The ultimate goal of this project is to port the neuroevolutionary algorithm to Unity for more realistic 3D modeling.
